# unity-utilities
* My utility code when prototyping with Unity. I will update this repo from time to time.
* I put my references of code implementation in the scripts directly. This is also a note for my self.
* Some of these codes, are inspired by my colleagues and we create them from scratch and learn from others.
* If you were interested, you could also improve them and add more features into this repo.
* Finally, I hope I can improve my programming skill by maintain this personal coding toolkit. So, it more like a personal goal instead of a big open source project. The goal is simple, just to make our life easier when doing something with Unity.

## Currently Functionality
* Spherical coordinate convert to Catersian coordinate
* Random function calls
